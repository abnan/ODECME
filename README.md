Arxiv link: 

This repository has two notebooks. Running them is as simple as opening them in Colab and uploading the files you want as the fixed and the moving images/volumes.

1. [ODECME_2D](https://github.com/abnan/ODECME/blob/master/ODECME_2D.ipynb) - Example for 2D registration using images from [ANHIR](https://anhir.grand-challenge.org/)
2. [ODECME_3D](https://github.com/abnan/ODECME/blob/master/ODECME_ADNI.ipynb) - Example for 3D registration using volumes from [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-tool/standardized-mri-data-sets/)
